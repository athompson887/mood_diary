## Overview

Mood Diary ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mood tracking application.

**The short version: We don't collect your data. Everything stays on your device.**

## Information Collection

- Mood entries and ratings
- Notes and journal entries
- Activity selections
- App preferences and settings

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it.

## Data Storage

Your mood data is stored using secure local storage on your device. This means:
